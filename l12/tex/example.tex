\section{Example}
A study concerns the approval ratings of a prime minister in twosurveys.In the first survey, ratings were obtained on 1600 citizens andthen in a second survey, six months later, the same citizens wereresurveyed.

\begin{itemize}
	\item In the 1st survey, 944 indicated approval of the Prime Minister's
	performance in office.
	\item In the 2nd survey, 880 indicated approval.
\end{itemize}

There each subject has two observation. So that we have 1600 pairs of data out of 1600 people.

The null hypothesis is 
\[H_0: \text{the approval rate does not change.}\]
It can be reduced to
\[H_0: \text{the odds of approval does not change.}\]
It means that the probability of going from approval to disapproval is the
same as the probability of going from disapproval to approval.

In the following code, we identify that 4 more percentage of people going from approval to disapproval. McNemar test tells us that it is significant.

kappa test focus on the agreement while the McNemar Test focus on the disagreement.
