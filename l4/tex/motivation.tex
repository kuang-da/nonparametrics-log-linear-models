\section{Motivation of Nonparametric Methods}
Traditional parametric testing methods are based on theassumption that data are generated by well-known distributions,characterized by one or more unknown parameters.

The critical values or alternatively the $p$-values is computedaccording to the distribution of the test statistic under the nullhypothesis, which can be derived from the assumptions relatedto the assumed underlying distribution of data.

But the above assumption is not always true. For example, if the data is semi-continuous and also zero inflated, then any assumed distribution is not true. We can still apply the parametric testing method on the data but the result is probably not reasonable.

When the parametric does not hold, nonparametric methods are the valid solutions. Nonparametric methods require relatively mild assumptionsregarding the underlying populations from which the data areobtained.

Note that when the parametric assumptions hold, the nonparametricmethods are only slightly less powerful than the parametricmethods.
