\section{Study Designs}

\subsection{Design 1: One Multinomial Sampling with n Fixed}
If the total sample size of observations n is fixed in advance
(e.g., in a cross-sectional study), then a multinomial sampling
model might be used where cell counts are treated asmultinomial random variables with index n and probabilities $\pi_{ij}$.

\subsection{Design 2: $I$ Multinomial Distributions}
If the row totals $n_i$ are fixed in advance, the counts $n_{ij}$ have a
multinomial distribution with index $n_i$. So there are $I$ multinomial distributions.

Sometimes $n_i$ is not fixed in advance. The row variable is an explanatory variable and the column variable is a response variable. $\P(Y = j| X = i)$.

\subsection{Design 3: The Lady Tasting Tea}
If both row and column totals are fixed by design, then ahyper-geometric sampling distribution applies for the cell counts.

\subsection{Design 4}
If observations are to be collected over a certain period of time
and cross-classified into one of the $I \times J$ categories, then a
Poisson sampling model might be used where cell counts are
treated as independent Poisson random variables with
parameters $\mu_{ij}$'s.
